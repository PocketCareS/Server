# PocketCare S - Android

<img src="logo.png" width="300">

**Call for code submission for COVID-19 track.**

PocketCare S is a comprehensive smartphone-based solution for monitoring close encounters. It is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) based solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) to see if they are close to each other (less than 2m). If so, the smartphone records the duration of such a close encounter with another beacon. 

PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual.

## The Architecture

## Getting Started 

**Due to emulators not supporting bluetooth, close encounter detection will not work on emulators.**

### Prerequisites for installation on local machine

Before you begin, make sure you satisfy the following requirements in order to run the server on your local system:

1. Spring Tool Suite latest version.
2. MongoDB Server setup on your local system. [Link](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
3. JAVA 8 or above installed on the system.
4. NPM (node package manager) which can be installed from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Steps to install server on local system

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure the MongoDB server is up and running.
3. Open the project in the spring tool suite IDE
4. Configure the MongoDB server Credentials [reference]
5. Configure the IBM push Notification credentials [reference]
6. Right-click on the project and run as spring boot app
7. Now you must see the project running on the server.
8. Get the IP address of your system.
9. Access the URL \&lt;ip\&gt;:8080/user/sample. If it prints &quot;Hello World&quot; Then the server is up and running.
10. Update the file src\&gt;main\&gt;resources\&gt;application.properties file
11. Configure the IP address in the Android [reference], iOS [reference] and web portal[reference].

#### Steps to configure MongoDB database on IBM Openshift

1. Open the redshift console
2. After clicking on the project, a screen similar to the image below should appear. Just click on the Administrator in the top left corner and select Developer from the drop-down menu.

![](RackMultipart20200731-4-1p1bw0t_html_e62720c129b0c859.png)

13. Open the server application on your system.
14. Open the src\&gt;main\&gt;resources\&gt;application.properties file
15. #mongodb://\&lt;db-username\&gt;:\&lt;db-password\&gt;@\&lt;db-ip\&gt;:\&lt;db-port\&gt;/${spring.data.mongodb.name}
16. Mention the username, password.
17. Mention the cluster IP in place of \&lt;db-ip\&gt;
18. By default dbport is 27017. If not, mention the customised port in place of db-port


### Steps to install server on IBM's cloud openshift 


1. Get a RedHat openshift device on IBM cloud with the configuration of your choice.

![](RackMultipart20200731-4-1p1bw0t_html_1c309bffeda063cd.png)

2. Open the redshift cloud console: Dashboard \&gt; Clusters \&gt; open cluster \&gt; openshift web console

![](RackMultipart20200731-4-1p1bw0t_html_ff69cd97a6fb4dde.png)

3. After clicking on the project, a screen similar to the image below should appear. Just click on the Administrator in the top left corner and select Developer from the drop-down menu. ![](RackMultipart20200731-4-1p1bw0t_html_84ebe914834c887b.png)
4. On the screen that loads, click on From Git.

![](RackMultipart20200731-4-1p1bw0t_html_2d00f721eaf2d28e.png)

5. In the Git Repo URL section, paste the link &quot; **https://github.com/PocketCareS/server**&quot; from the Github repository.

Note: Click on More Advanced Options to specify the branch name(if-any). By default, the branch is master and we do not need to specify it.

6. Scroll down to select Builder Image. It is supposed to be Java in our case. After clicking on Java, make sure to change the Java version to 8 from the drop-down that appears. ![](RackMultipart20200731-4-1p1bw0t_html_7d48a7a733b4dd62.png)
7. Let other options be as they are, no fiddling with them. Just make sure that the checkbox in the Advanced Options section is checked as shown in the image below and then click on Create.
8. Click on the penguin logo on the screen. We can see that a build is already in progress. Keep a little patience and wait for the build to finish.
9. As soon as the build is finished, a pod will automatically be deployed. Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your spring-boot application on Redhat Openshift nonchalantly.

![](RackMultipart20200731-4-1p1bw0t_html_84ebe914834c887b.png)

10. To get the URL go under the Routes section.

The link in this section is your newly deployed spring-boot application.

## How does PocketCare S Work?

### Key Highlights (Mobile Application)

1. Close encounter data will be displayed in the mobile application after a close encounter session starts. A close encounter session starts when two people are within **2 meters** for at least **5 minutes**. 
2. The **virtual bluetooth name** changes every hour to ensure **user privacy**. 
3. Data upload to the server takes place every hour.
4. Data is stored in user's phone for a maximum of 14 days.

## Built With 

In this submission, we have used IBMâ€™s Cloud **Red Hat OpenShift** to deploy our server (using **OpenJDK 8**), database (using **MongoDB**), the web portal (using **Node Js server**) and **IBM Push notification service** from **IBM Bluemix** in the android application of PocketCare S as a proof of concept. In the future, we will consider integrating other IBM services into the PocketCare S solution.
